    \title Customizing Qt Quick Extras 2
    \brief A set of UI controls to create user interfaces in Qt Quick

    Qt Quick Controls consist of a hierarchy (tree) of items. In order to
    provide a custom look'n'feel, the default implementation of each can be
    replaced with a custom item. The following snippets present the default
    implementations of various items. These can be used as a starting point
    to implement custom look'n'feel.

        Dial consists of two visual items: \l {Control::background}{background}
        and \l {Dial::handle}{handle}.
